   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. **Import on Vercel**: Dashboard → "New Project" → Import your repo
4. **Add API key**: Project Settings → Environment Variables:
   - Variable name: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - Value: `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE`
5. **Deploy**: Click "Deploy" button
6. **Done!** Your app is live at `https://yourapp.vercel.app`

### Option 2: Netlify (Alternative - 3 minutes)

1. **Create Netlify account**: [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) → Connect GitHub
2. **Import project**: Sites → Add new site → Import existing project
3. **Add API key**: Site Settings → Environment Variables:
   - Key: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - Value: `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE`
4. **Deploy**: Auto-deploys after adding environment variable
5. **Done!** Your app is live at `https://yourapp.netlify.app`

### Option 3: Test Locally First

```bash
# Your API key is already configured in .env.local
npm install
npm run dev
# App runs at http://localhost:5173
```

## 🔐 Security Confirmed

- ✅ **API key is secure** - stored safely as environment variable
- ✅ **Frontend protected** - no API key in browser code
- ✅ **Backend proxy created** - `/api/generate` endpoint handles AI requests
- ✅ **Build successful** - tested and working
- ✅ **Dependencies clean** - no vulnerabilities found

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [x] Google Gemini API key added (`YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE`)
- [x] Local environment configured (`.env.local` created)
- [x] Build process tested (`npm run build` successful)
- [x] Security configured (API key protected, `.gitignore` updated)
- [x] Deployment configs created (`vercel.json`, `netlify.toml`)
- [ ] Choose deployment platform (Vercel or Netlify)
- [ ] Push code to GitHub repository
- [ ] Configure environment variables on hosting platform

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Choose Vercel or Netlify** (recommend Vercel for this setup)
2. **Push your code to GitHub**
3. **Follow the 5 steps** for your chosen platform above
4. **Test your deployed app** by uploading an image and generating a remodel

## 💡 Tips

- **First deployment**: Use Vercel - it's optimized for this exact setup
- **API costs**: Google Gemini has generous free tier, pay only for usage
- **Updates**: Just push to GitHub - auto-deploys on both platforms
- **Custom domains**: Both platforms support custom domains in free tier

## 🚨 Important

**NEVER commit your `.env.local` file** - it contains your API key and is already in `.gitignore`
